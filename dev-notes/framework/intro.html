<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
<p>This ain't the code.</p>
<p>In other words, the actual design/code may be radically different, and
this document probably will trail any major overhauls of the
design/code (speaking from past experience).</p>
<p>Updates welcome, as are suggestions and questions- please dig through
all documentations in the dir this doc is in however, since there is a
lot of info (both current and historical) related to it. Collapsing
info into this doc is attempted, but explanation of the full
restriction protocol (fex) is a <em>lot</em> of info, and original idea is
from previous redesign err... designs. Short version, historical, but
still relevant info for restriction is in layout.txt. Other
subsystems/design choices have their basis quite likely from other
docs in this directory, so do your homework please :)</p>

<h2>General design/idea/approach/requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#general-design-idea-approach-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All pythonic components installed by pkgcore <em>must</em> be within
pkgcore.* namespace. No more polluting python's namespace, plain and
simple. Third party plugins to pkgcore aren't bound by this however
(their mess, not ours).</p>
<p>API flows from the config definitions, <em>everything</em> internal is
effectively the same. Basically, config data gives you your starter
objects which from there, you dig deeper into the innards as needed
action wise.</p>
<p>The general design is intended to heavily abuse OOP.
Further, delegation of actions down to components <em>must</em> be abided by,
example being repo + cache interaction. repo does what it can, but for
searching the cache, let the cache do it. Assume what you're
delegating to knows the best way to handle the request, and probably
can do its job better then some external caller (essentially).</p>
<p>Actual configuration is pretty heavily redesigned. Classes and
functions that should be constructed based on data from the user's
configuration have a &quot;hint&quot; describing their arguments. The global
config class uses these hints to convert and typecheck the values in
the user's configuration. Actual configuration file reading and type
conversion is done by a separate class, meaning the global manager is
not tied to a single format, or even to configuration read from a file
on disk.</p>
<p>Encapsulation, extensibility/modularity, delegation, and allowing
parallelizing of development should be key focuses in
implementing/refining this high level design doc. Realize
parallelizing is a funky statement, but it's apt; work on the repo
implementations can proceed without being held up by cache work, and
vice versa.</p>
<p>Final comment re: design goals, defining chunks of callable code and
plugging it into the framework is another bit of a goal. Think
twisted, just not quite as prevalent (their needs/focus is much
different from ours, twisted is the app, your code is the lib, vice
versa for pkgcore).</p>
<p>Back to config. Here's general notion of config 'chunks' of the
subsystem, (these map out to run time objects unless otherwise stated):</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>domain
+-- profile (optional)
+-- fetcher (default)
+-- repositories
+-- resolver (default)
+-- build env data?
|    never actually instantiated, no object)
\-- livefs_repo (merge target, non optional)

repository
+-- cache   (optional)
+-- fetcher (optional)
+-- sync    (optional, may change)
\-- sync cache (optional, may chance)

profile
+-- build env?
+-- sets (system mainly).
\-- visibility wrappers
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>domain is configuration data, accept_(license|keywords), use, cflags,
chost, features, etc. profile, dependent on the profile class you
choose is either bound to a repository, or to user defined location on
disk (/etc/portage/profile fex). Domain knows to do incremental crap
upon profile settings, lifting package.* crap for visibility wrappers
for repositories also.</p>
<p>repositories is pretty straightforward.  portdir, binpkg, vdb, etc.</p>
<p>Back to domain. Domain's are your definition of pretty much what can
be done. Can't do jack without a domain, period. Can have multiple
domains also, and domains do <em>not</em> have to be local (remote domains
being a different class type). Clarifying, think of 500 desktop boxes,
and a master box that's responsible for managing them. Define an
appropriate domain class, and appropriate repository classes, and have
a config that holds the 500 domains (representing each box), and you
can push updates out via standard api trickery. In other words, the
magic is hidden away, just define remote classes that match defined
class rules (preferably inheriting from the base class, since
isinstance sanity checks will become the norm), and you could do
emerge --domain some-remote-domain -u glsa on the master box. Emerge
won't know it's doing remote crap. Pkgcore won't even. It'll just load
what you define in the config.</p>
<p>Ambitious? Yeah, a bit. Thing to note, the remote class additions will
exist outside of pkgcore proper most likely. Develop the code needed
in parallel to fleshing pkgcore proper out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the remote bit + multiple domains + class overrides in
config definition is _explicitly_ for the reasons above. That and
x-compile/embedded target building, which is a bit funkier.</p>
<p>Currently, portage has DEPEND and RDEPEND. How do you know what needs
be native to that box to build the package, what must be chost atoms?
Literally, how do you know which atoms, say the toolchain, must be
native vs what package's headers/libs must exist to build it? We need
an additional metadata key, BDEPEND (build depends).</p>
<p>If you have BDEPEND, you know what actually is ran locally in building
a package, vs what headers/libs are required. Subtle difference, but
BDEPEND would allow (with a sophisticated depresolver) toolchain to be
represented in deps, rather then the current unstated dep approach
profiles allow.</p>
<p>Aside from that, BDEPEND could be used for x-compile via inter-domain
deps; a ppc target domain on a x86 box would require BDEPEND from the
default domain (x86). So... that's useful.</p>
<p>So far, no one has shot this down, moreso, come up with reasons as to
why it wouldn't work, the consensus thus far is mainly &quot;err, don't
want to add the deps, too much work&quot;. Regarding work, use indirection.</p>

<h2>Config design<a class="headerlink" href="#config-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Portage thus far (&lt;=2.0.51*) has had variable ROOT (livefs merge
point), but no way to vary configuration data aside from via a
buttload of env vars. Further, there has been only one repository
allowed (overlays are just that, extensions of the 'master'
repository). Addition of support of any new format is mildly insane
due to hardcoding up the wing wang in the code, and
extension/modification of existing formats (ebuild) has some issues
(namely the doebuild block of code).</p>
<p>Goal is to address all of this crap. Format agnosticism at the
repository level is via an abstracted repository design that should
supply generic inspection attributes to match other formats.
Specialized searching is possible via match, thus extending the
extensibility of the prototype repository design.</p>
<p>Format agnosticism for building/merging is somewhat reliant on the
repo, namely package abstraction, and abstraction of building/merging
operations.</p>
<p>On disk configurations for alternatives formats is extensible via
changing section types, and plugging them into the domain definition.</p>
<p>Note alt. formats quite likely will never be implemented in pkgcore
proper, that's kind of the domain of pkgcore addons. In other words,
dpkg/rpm/whatever quite likely won't be worked on by pkgcore
developers, at least not in the near future (too many other things to
do).</p>
<p>The intention is to generalize the framework so it's possible for
others to do so if they choose however.</p>
<p>Why is this good? Ebuild format has issues, as does our profile
implementation. At some point, alternative formats/non-backwards
compatible tweaks to the formats (ebuild or profile) will occur, and
then people will be quite happy that the framework is generalized
(seriously, nothing is lost from a proper abstracted design, and
flexibility/power is gained).</p>

<h2>config's actions/operation<a class="headerlink" href="#config-s-actions-operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>pkgcore.config.load_config() is the entrance point, returns to you a
config object (pkgcore.config.central). This object gives you access
to the user defined configs, although only interest/poking at it
should be to get a domain object from it.</p>
<p>domain object is instantiated by config object via user defined
configuration. domains hold instantiated repositories, bind profile +
user prefs (use/accept_keywords) together, and _should_ simplify this
data into somewhat user friendly methods. (define this better).</p>
<p>Normal/default domain doesn't know about other domains, nor give a
damn. Embedded targets are domains, and _will_ need to know about the
livefs domain (root=/), so buildplan creation/handling may need to be
bound into domains.</p>

<h3>domain object<a class="headerlink" href="#domain-object" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>bit of debate on this one I expect. any package.{mask,unmask,keywords}
mangling is instantiated as a wrapper around repository instances upon
domain instantiation. code <em>should</em> be smart and lift any
package.{mask,unmask,keywords} wrappers from repositoriy instances and
collapse it, pointing at the raw repo (basically don't have N
wrappers, collapse it into a single wrapper). Not worth implementing
until the wrapper is a faster implementation then the current
pkgcore.repository.visibility hack though (currently O(N) for each pkg
instance, N being visibility restrictions/atoms). Once it's O(1),
collapsing makes a bit more sense (can be done in parallel however).</p>
<p>a word on inter repository dependencies... simply put, if the
repository only allows satisfying deps from the same repository, the
package instance's *DEPEND atom conversions should include that
restriction. Same trickery for keeping ebuilds from depping on
rpm/dpkg (and vice versa).</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>.repositories</dt><dd><p>in the air somewhat on this one. either indexablesequence, or a
repositorySet. Nice aspect of the latter is you can just use .match
with appropriate restrictions. very simply interface imo, although
should provide a way to pull individual repositories/labels of said
repos from the set though. basically, mangle a .raw_repo
indexablesequence type trick (hackish, but nail it down when reach
that bridge)</p>

<p>digressing for a moment...</p>
<p>note you can group repositories together, think portdir +
portdir_overlay1 + portdir_overlay2. Creation of a repositoryset
basically would involve passing multiple instantiating repo's, and
depending on that classes semantics, it internally handles the
stacking (right most positional arg repo overrides 2nd right most, ...
overriding left most) So... stating it again/clearly if it ain't
obvious, everything is configuration/instantiating of objects, chucked
around/mangled by the pkgcore framework.</p>
<p>What <em>isn't</em> obvious is that since a repository set gets handed
instantiated repositories, each repo, <em>including</em> the set instance,
can should be able to have its own cache (this is assuming it's
ebuild repos through and through). Why? Cache data doesn't change for
the most part exempting which repo a cpv is from, and the eclass
stacking. Handled individually, a cache bound to portdir <em>should</em> be
valid for portdir alone, it shouldn't carry data that is a result of
eclass stacking from another overlay + that portdir. That's the
business of the repositoryset. Consequence of this is that the
repositoryset needs to basically reach down into the repository it's
wrapping, get the pkg data, <em>then</em> rerequest the keys from that ebuild
with a different eclass stack. This would be a bit expensive, although
once inherit is converted to a pythonic implementation (basically
handing the path to the requested eclass down the pipes to
ebuild*.sh), it should be possible to trigger a fork in the inherit,
and note python side that multiple sets of metadata are going to be
coming down the pipe. That should alleviate the cost a bit, but it
also makes multiple levels of cache reflecting each repository
instance a bit nastier to pull off till it's implemented.</p>
<p>So... short version. Harring is a perfectionist, and says it should be
this way. reality of the situation makes it a bit trickier. Anyone
interested in attempting the mod, feel free, otherwise harring will
take a crack at it since he's being anal about having it work in such
a fashion.</p>
<p>Or... could do thus. repo + cache as a layer, wrapped with a 'regen'
layer that handles cache regeneration as required. Via that, would
give the repositoryset a way to override and use its own specialized
class that ensures each repo gets what's proper for its layer. Think
raw_repo type trick.</p>

<section id="metadatarestriction">
<h3>metadataRestriction<a class="headerlink" href="#metadatarestriction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mentioning this for the sake of pointing out a subclass of it,
DescriptionRestriction- this will be a class representing matching
against description data. See repo.match and cache.match above. The
short version is that it encapsulates the description search (a <em>very</em>
slow search right now) so that repo.match can hand off to the cache
(delegation), and the cache can do the search itself, however it sees
fit.</p>
<p>So... for the default cache, flat_list (19500 ebuilds == 19500 files to
read for a full searchDesc), still is slow unless flat_list gets some
desc. cache added to it internally. If it's a sql based cache, the
sql_template should translate the query into the appropriate select
statement, which should make it <em>much</em> faster.</p>
<p>Restating that, delegation is <em>absolutely</em> required. There have been
requests to add intermediate caches to the tree, or move data (whether
collapsing metadata.xml or moving data out of ebuilds) so that the
form it is stored is in quicker to search. These approaches are wrong.
Should be clear from above that a repository can, and likely will be
remote on some boxes. Such a shift of metadata does nothing but make
repository implementations that harder, and shift power away from what
knows best how to use it. Delegation is a massively more powerful
approach, allowing for more extensibility, flexibility and <em>speed</em>.</p>
<p>Final restating- searchDesc is matching against cache data. The cache
(whether flat_list, anydbm, sqlite, or a remote sql based cache) is
the <em>authority</em> about the fastest way to do searches of its data.
Programmers get pist off when users try and tell them how something
internally should be implemented- it's fundamentally the same
scenario. The cache class the user chooses knows how to do its job
the best, provide methods of handing control down to it, and let it do
its job (delegation). Otherwise you've got a backseat driver
situation, which doesn't let those in the know, do the deciding (cache
knows, repo doesn't).</p>
<p>Mind you not trying to be harsh here. If in reading through the full
doc you disagree, question it; if after speeding up current cache
implementation, note that any such change must be backwards
compatible, and not screw up the possibilities of
encapsulation/delegation this design aims for.</p>

<h3>logging<a class="headerlink" href="#logging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>flesh this out (define this basically). short version, no more
writemsg type trickery, use a proper logging framework.</p>
</section>
<section id="ebuild-daemon-sh">
<h3>ebuild-daemon.sh<a class="headerlink" href="#ebuild-daemon-sh" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hardcoded paths <em>have</em> to go. /usr/lib/portage/bin == kill it. Upon
initial loadup of ebuild.sh, dump the default/base path down to the
daemon, <em>including</em> a setting for /usr/lib/portage/bin . Likely
declare -xr it, then load the actual ebuild*.sh libs. Backwards
compatibility for that is thus, ebuild.sh defines the var itself in
global scope if it's undefined. Semblence of backwards compatibility
(which is actually somewhat pointless since I'm about to blow it out
of the water).</p>
<p>Ebuild-daemon.sh needs a function for dumping a _large_ amount of data
into bash, more then just a line or two.</p>
<p>For the ultra paranoid, we load up eclasses, ebuilds, profile.bashrc's
into python side, pipe that to gpg for verification, then pipe that
data straight into bash. No race condition possible for files
used/transferred in this manner.</p>
<p>A thought. The screw around speed up hack preload_eclasses added in
ebd's heyday of making it as fast as possible would be one route;
Basically, after verification of an elib/eclass, preload the eclass
into a func in the bash env. and declare -r the func after the fork.
This protects the func from being screwed with, and gives a way to (at
least per ebd instance) cache the verified bash code in memory.</p>
<p>It could work surprisingly enough (the preload_eclass command already
works), and probably be fairly fast versus the alternative. So... the
race condition probably can be flat out killed off without massive
issues. Still leaves a race for perms on any <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">files/*</span></code>, but neh. A)
That stuff shouldn't be executed, B) security is good, but we can't
cover every possibility (we can try, but dimishing returns)</p>
<p>A lesser, but still tough version of this is to use the indirection
for actual sourcing to get paths instead. No EBUILD_PATH, query python
side for the path, which returns either '' (which ebd interprets as
&quot;err, something is whacked, time to scream&quot;), or the actual path.</p>
<p>In terms of timing, gpg verification of ebuilds probably should occur
prior to even spawning ebd.sh. profile, eclass, and elib sourcing
should use this technique to do on the fly verification though. Object
interaction for that one is going to be <em>really</em> fun, as will be
mapping config settings to instantiation of objs.</p>
